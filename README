Building the system
====================

Need to build LLVM 3.0/3.1 and clang 3.0/3.1
Need to build repo rcs

./configure --with-rcssrc=<rcs srouce directory> --with-rcsobj=<rcs object directory> --prefix=`llvm-config --prefix`
make
make install

Running the system
====================
Injects Loom's update engine into the application.
e.g. loom_instrument.py httpd

Start Loom's controller server
loom_ctl

Start the instrumented application
e.g. ./httpd.loom

After the instrumented application starts, update it with execution filters
e.g.
loom_ctl -add <some pid> <some filter file>
loom_ctl -delete <some pid> <filter ID>
loom_ctl -help to see more

Utilities
====================
loom_view_proc.py lists all Loom threads, including all threads in the
instrumented application and all Loom's daemon threads

loom_simple_ctl.py is a simple controller that only supports singlethreaded
programs. See the startup message for usage.

Format of Loom execution filter
====================
See eval/template.lm
